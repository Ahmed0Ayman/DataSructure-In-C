# DataSructure-In-C



as far as you know how data structures is important in a diversity fields that help us to data with large data from traversal , sort , search 
data structure is only an algorithm (some lines of code ) each algorithm has some properties (execution time , how many resources ,behaviour in big data ,etc) at hte end we how decided which algorith is suitable to our application 
so I tried to build all these algorithms from scratch tnat is not every thing I also tried to make these implementation reliable and flexible
